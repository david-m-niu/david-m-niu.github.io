In my first blog post, I'll discuss the proof of the Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym Theorem as given in Folland's *Real Analysis*.

To begin with, this is really the combination of the Radon-Nikodym theorem and Lebesgue's decomposition theorem.

The proof can be reduced to the case where $\nu$ and $\mu$ are finite positive measures; this is because if they are $\sigma$-finite measures . . .
